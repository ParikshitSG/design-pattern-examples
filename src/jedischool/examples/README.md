### Disclaimer:

These examples only try to convery a broader understanding of how design patterns can be applied under a specific circumstance.
Design Patterns are language agnostic and as such it is possible to implement a design pattern in a different way while keeping the core idea intact.

The code here is in no way production ready, only the concepts are.
